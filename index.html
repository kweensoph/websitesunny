<h1> sunsets in different places of the world</h1>

 

<p> At sunrise and sunset, the sun is low on the horizon, and the rays of sunlight pass through more air in the atmosphere than they do when the sun is higher in the sky. When sunlight passes through more atmosphere, there are more particles to scatter the light.</p>
